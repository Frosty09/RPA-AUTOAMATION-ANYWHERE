## Date: 2nd October 2019

## Agenda
1. Intro
2. Automation anywhere architechture
3. Web control room
4. Bot creator
5. Bot runner
6. Best Practice and techniques


# Intro
* Bot insight -> analytics platform
* Rpa platform -> task and meta bot, meta bot is the advanced version of the task bot
* Cognitive platform-> IQ bot 

# RPA platform
* Rule based
* front end automation
* Multi system integration
* Structured Data

# Cognitive platform
* Algorith based decision
* self learning activity
* Vision,NLP
* Semi structured data
* Dark data ->semi structured(pdf,images) or unstructured , 80 % data is in this form
* IQ bots helps to work on semi structured or unstructred data
* ML and AI abilities are supported with IQ bots

# Analytics Platform
* Provides business insights
* measures effectiveness
* make scaling decisions
* how much should be invest to make sure revnue is being generated

# Able to automate
* reading data from certain platform and writing to another
* works both for web bases and desktop based
* works awesome with Structured Data and good with semi-structured
* rule based decisions

# lacks
* Not able to work with handwritten data
* non rule based general calls

# Notes
* Once bot is set up on control room then it can be used to all other machines connected with same control room
* There are 2 types of clint: 
  1. Development Client -> bot creators
  2. Runtime Client -> bot execution, required once the bot is deployed to control room
* v-10.5, 8GB of RAM is required, CLient only would require 4gb RAM
* current version-: 11.3.3
* Latest Version of AAE Client requires around 16GB RAM
* Control room is equipped with lots of tools and activities, its different in version 11 then 10
* AA community is applicable only for 1 month
* License in AA are customized thus can be developed based on requirements and charges will be applicable as per the needs
* To execute or use the Control Room , we require License to be uploaded on server through the control room application only
* Bots can be scheduled to be execute at certain time only
* autologin feature -> it allows the machine to unlock the software, login the client and do the automated tasks

# Runtime Client
* It is classified into 2 catgories:
  1. Attended -> Requires human interaction
  2. Unattended -> no human interaction required
  
# Time to Create
* KeyStrokes -> insert data in some other application
* Select Window shows the list of all applications opened on your system
* to perform certain hotkey actions just choose options from given list
e.g [ENTER]
* the commands can be reordered by move up or move down option
* Open Program/Files -> to open application,just type its name
* To upload your bot to main control room , just right click on bot file and click upload
* Community edition software does not have access to control room(users can not be created, licenss can not be managed)
* ```atmx``` standard bot file extension
* Repository Manager -> it allows the control room admin to run or schedule the uploaded bots
* To create a user:
  1. Actions Tab
  2. Create User Tab
  3. Set the details and all details are editable
* Various Roles available
  1. Admin -> can never login to the client and make bot, License Allocation:None
  2. AnalyticsConsumer -> work on BotInsight platform, utilize the reports
  3. AnalyticsExpert -> work on BotInsight platform, process the reports
  4. Basic -> mandatory, as it allows to login , for both runner and developer client
  5. IQBotServices  -> Cognitive platform
  6. IQBotValidator -> Cognitive platform
* Automation Anywhere works on R back policy, custom bots can be created to restrict or determine the permissions allowed for a user
* Control Room Recognizes the ```BOTS``` based on their machine id
* Operation Room -> Shows the task that are currently in progress
* Audit Trail -> Its the log file which stores the data regarding each and every activity, success / failures , reasons etc.
* Roles and Permission -> These can be set in control room and custom roles can be created as well
* App Management -> To integrate the system with other applications
* Outgoing Mail Server Application -> to send mails with reference to working or progress of any bots can be set
* On Installation of Control Room , two categories or options are available:
  1. Express Mode -> the master key gets set with machine
  2. Manual Mode -> master key is need to be given at every login instance
* Secure Recording -> It is required to be ```enabled``` so that the recorder would not record snapshots and take only Abstract information
* Help / Support -> it can be customized as per the need

## To Set Auto Login
* Click on Tools
* Click Options
* In Login Settings
  * Set Username and Password
  * Check auto login and scheduler task
  * Finally Apply
